1. Use lambda expressions to cover different math operations (sum, extract, division, multiply)
2. UI part is free choice (might be a webapp, rest endpoint, console app)
3. As a user I must be able to provide the input data (either input it manually or read ex from file)
4. As a user I must be able to choose what kind of operations should be done on the input data 
5. Format of input data is free choice (might be ex. pairs of numbers)
6. As a user I want to be able to choose consumer/collector for the data (from predefined ones) ex. I would like to get all results printed on screen or written to file. 

so as a User i Might want to do the following: 
â€‹I have a file with pair of numbers 
	I want this file to be read, and I want to do sum on those pairs
	I want the results to be saved to a file 'result.txt'
